## Project Overview

### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to create a web scraper that can:
1. Extract the current price of a specific product from its Amazon listing.
2. Extract the current rating of the same product.
3. Store the extracted data for further analysis or use.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core programming language used for scripting and automation.
- **BeautifulSoup**: A Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents, used to extract data from web pages.
- **Requests**: A Python library for sending HTTP requests to interact with web pages.
- **Pandas**: A data manipulation and analysis library used to store and manage scraped data.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For documenting and running the Python code in an interactive environment.
- **Docker** (optional): To containerize the application for consistency and ease of deployment.

By setting up this project, you can automate the process of tracking product prices and ratings on Amazon, which can be useful for personal use or as a foundation for more advanced data analysis projects.
